AWS CloudTrail Monitoring & Logging Lab

Overview

This lab demonstrates how to enable activity logging and monitoring inside an AWS environment using AWS CloudTrail.

The purpose of this lab was to understand how security teams track user actions, detect suspicious behaviour, and maintain audit visibility across cloud infrastructure.

Cloud logging is a critical control used in real-world environments for:
	•	Security monitoring
	•	Incident response
	•	Compliance
	•	Forensic investigations

⸻

Objectives
	•	Enable account activity logging
	•	Create a multi-region CloudTrail trail
	•	Store logs securely in an S3 bucket
	•	Generate activity events
	•	Review logged actions in Event History

⸻

Technologies Used
	•	AWS CloudTrail
	•	Amazon S3
	•	AWS Management Console

⸻

Lab Steps

1. Created a CloudTrail Trail
	•	Opened AWS CloudTrail
	•	Created a new trail named:

security-monitoring-trail
	•	Enabled:

Multi-region logging

This ensures activity across all AWS regions is captured.

⸻

2. Log Storage Configuration
	•	Created a new S3 bucket for log storage
	•	Ensures audit logs are preserved securely

⸻

3. Generated Test Activity
To verify logging:
	•	Accessed IAM
	•	Viewed S3 services
	•	Created a test resource

⸻

4. Reviewed Event History
Observed logged events such as:
	•	Console login
	•	Service access
	•	Resource actions

This confirms monitoring is active.

⸻

Security Concepts Demonstrated
	•	Audit logging
	•	Detection controls
	•	Accountability
	•	Non-repudiation
	•	Security visibility
	•	Monitoring user behaviour

⸻

Why This Matters

In real environments, CloudTrail helps:
	•	Detect unauthorised access
	•	Investigate incidents
	•	Track configuration changes
	•	Meet compliance requirements

Without logging, organisations have no visibility into what users or attackers are doing.

⸻

Evidence

Screenshots included:
	•	CloudTrail trail configuration
	•	Event history logs
	•	Enabled multi-region monitoring

⸻

Key Takeaway

Enabling logging is one of the first security controls implemented in any cloud environment.

If you cannot see activity, you cannot detect threats.
